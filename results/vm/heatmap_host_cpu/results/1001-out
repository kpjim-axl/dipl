This system uses 8 bytes per array element.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Array size = 50000000 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 381.5 MiB (= 0.4 GiB).
Total memory required = 1144.4 MiB (= 1.1 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 20 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
 will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.

Number of Threads requested = 4
Number of Threads counted = 4

Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 72408 microseconds.
   (= 72408 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.

STREAM version $Revision: 5.10 $
-------------------------------------------------------------
This system uses 8 bytes per array element.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Array size = 50000000 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 381.5 MiB (= 0.4 GiB).
Total memory required = 1144.4 MiB (= 1.1 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 20 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
 will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Number of Threads requested = 4
Number of Threads counted = 4
-------------------------------------------------------------
Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 56488 microseconds.
   (= 56488 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.
-------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING -- The above is only a rough guideline.
For best results, please be sure you know the
precision of your system timer.

STREAM version $Revision: 5.10 $
-------------------------------------------------------------
This system uses 8 bytes per array element.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Array size = 50000000 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 381.5 MiB (= 0.4 GiB).
Total memory required = 1144.4 MiB (= 1.1 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 20 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
 will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.

Number of Threads requested = 4
Number of Threads counted = 4

Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 59147 microseconds.
   (= 59147 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that

This system uses 8 bytes per array element.

Array size = 50000000 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 381.5 MiB (= 0.4 GiB).
Total memory required = 1144.4 MiB (= 1.1 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 20 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
 will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.

Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 52409 microseconds.

Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.
