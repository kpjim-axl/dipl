This system uses 8 bytes per array element.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Array size = 50000000 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 381.5 MiB (= 0.4 GiB).
Total memory required = 1144.4 MiB (= 1.1 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 20 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
 will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.

Number of Threads requested = 4
Number of Threads counted = 4

Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 50909 microseconds.
   (= 50909 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.

WARNING -- The above is only a rough guideline.
For best results, please be sure you know the
